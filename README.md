allow you to present multiple insights in a single view, enabling you to tell a comprehensive
story with your Spotify data.

Interactivity and Filters: Tableau offers interactivity features that allow users to interact with
the visualizations. You can add filters, drill-down options, and other interactive elements to
enhance the user experience.

publish them to Tableau Server or Tableau Public. This allows you to share your insights with
others, embed visualizations in websites, or collaborate with teammates.
